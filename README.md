## Juniper Gardiner

Tech hobbyist & computer toucher. I like to mess with computers! I have a ton of hardware I love to mess with and I develop software.

I am mostly known for my work with [Minecraft modding](https://modrinth.com/user/Juniper) but most of my software development is related to projects I find interesting to work on - Such as simulation, [machine learning](forgejo.sillyjune.xyz/juniper/astra-api) and whatever I am hyperfocusing on at that given time.
## Current Projects

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> As of 27/08/2025 all of my repositories have been migrated to my [Forgejo Instance](https://forgejo.sillyjune.xyz/juniper), with most being mirrored on [Git Gay](https://git.gay/juniper). If you're looking for a project, you should look there.
