## Juniper Gardiner

Tech hobbyist & computer toucher. I like to mess with computers! I have a ton of hardware I love to mess with and I develop software.

I am mostly known for my work with [Minecraft modding](https://modrinth.com/user/Juniper) but most of my software development is related to projects I find interesting to work on - Such as simulation, [machine learning](forgejo.sillyjune.xyz/juniper/astra-api) and whatever I am hyperfocusing on at that given time.
## Current Projects

> [Astra API](https://forgejo.sillyjune.xyz/juniper/astra-api) - A machine learning (No relation to generative AI, LLMs or the like) API written in Rust, C and a bit of C++, with GPU accelleration support.

> [Minecraft Vanilla Notebook](https://github.com/JunePrimavera/Minecraft-Vanilla-Notebook) - A small Minecraft modding project adding a notebook to the pause menu.

> [Minecraft Ecological](https://github.com/JunePrimavera/Minecraft-Ecological) - A small Minecraft modding project adding a bunch of small features to make the world grow and change over time.

Alongside these, i've been working on many smaller projects - I'm also the lead developer for an upcoming game.
