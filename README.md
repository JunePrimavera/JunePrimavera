## Juniper Gardiner

Tech hobbyist & computer toucher. I like to mess with computers! I have a ton of hardware I love to mess with and I develop software.

I am mostly known for my work with [Minecraft modding](https://modrinth.com/user/Juniper) but most of my software development hobby is related to more intricate private projects - Such as simulation, [machine learning](forgejo.sillyjune.xyz/juniper/astra-api) and whatever I am hyperfocusing on at that given time.
## Current Projects

[Astra API](https://forgejo.sillyjune.xyz/juniper/astra-api) - A machine learning API written in Rust, C and a bit of C++, with GPU accelleration support.

[Minecraft Vanilla Notebook](https://github.com/JunePrimavera/Minecraft-Vanilla-Notebook) - A small Minecraft modding project adding a notebook to the pause menu.
